# Command Pattern

> "wrap an action so you can execute different actions in the same way and defer their execution"
- You can pass parameters to a constructor and use later when performing the action
- command object keeps information to pass to action


## Review OO commands
- explain how actions are expressed as different Objects
- convert `execute()` to expression body
